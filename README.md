# Why I made this:
i was bored lol
# What this is for
tbh it just makes ur code unreadable. good for protecting ip ( hi github so i dont endorse/condone exploiting so dont state your reasoning XD )
# How this works:
one word. bytecode
tutorial: open roblox studio, even if ur doing PLAIN luau this is mandatory.
1: download rbxstu at https://github.com/SecondNewtonLaw/RbxStu-Releases/releases/latest
2: run rbxstu
3: inject rbxstu into a running roblox studio process
4: open whatever folder you put rbxstu in and create a CodeToObfuscate.txt file with the code you want to obfuscate
5: run this (script) from /src/main.lua as the raw code
or use a roblox exploit executor (hi github so i do not and never will condone this)
credits to fiu & luau ception
itll write a `obfuscated{tick()}.lua` file which contains your obfuscated code
i recommend moving the obfuscated file and naming it so you know whats what. or store hashes
OR: 
do the same but instead use ./src/lune.lua
and install lune from @lune-org/lune (requires rokit and a inited rokit project using rokit init. you gotta restart after installing rokit to use rokit in command line)
then do lune run ./src/lune.lua
TODO: 
make it accept IF and OF as params for the lune version
